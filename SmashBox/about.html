    <h1>About Smash Box</h1>
    
    <p>Smash Box is a Web 3.0 Virtual Reality (VR) punch/kick game inspired by other games such as <A href="https://moonrider.xyz">Moon Rider</A>, Beat Saber, and the Reflex Alley trainer of Knockout League, but unlike them Smash Box has more of an emphasis on Martial Arts and is more of an exercise/fitness game.
    
    <p>Game play in Smash Box requires some moderate jumping, and hence could be considered a form of High Intensity Training (HIIT).  Not as intense as something like box jumps, but still high intensity.  Appropriate care should be taken when jumping and kicking while wearing VR goggles.
    
    <p>This software should not be considered a substitute for medical advise.  Please consult with your doctor before starting any new exercise program.
    
    <h2>Targets</h2>
    
    <p>Cube-shaped targets (red or blue) are to be punched.  Pyramid-shaped targets, in most cases, are to be kicked.  Points are counted for punching red or blue cubes with the proper hand, but points will not be counted for kicks until full-body tracking is more widely adopted.
    
    <p>Black-colored cubes are dumbbels.  Avoid them.
    
    <p>Beige-colored plates moving along the ground are jump hurdles.  Jump over the hurdles where possible.  However doing so will not be tracked until full-body tracking is more widely adopted.  In some cases such as jumping punches the hurdle is placed to show where to jump to execute the strike.
    
    <p>Some games such as <A href="https://moonrider.xyz">Moon Rider</A> only have the user punch single targets.  The Reflex Alley in Knockout League only has the user hit a string of three targets as a "combination" punch. In Smash Box most kicks and punches (with the exception of those that simulate blocking other punches) are represented by a string of three targets to encourage proper follow-through in the execution of the kick or punch.
    
    <h2>Parallel Hops</h2>
    
    <p>Parallel Hops add an additional aspect of conditioning training to Smash Box.  In the case of Parallel Hops, the red and blue pyramids moving along the ground are foot positions rather than kicking targets.
    
    <h2>Side-Blade Kicks</h2>
    
    <p>Pyramid-shaped markers and jump hurdles traveling off to one side indicate that a side-blade kick will be executed to that side.  This provides time for the user to turn and visually acquire the incoming kick targets for the side-blade kick.  When the side-moving pyramids are noticed, the player needs to immediately turn and visually acquire the side-blade kick targets.  Additional slower jump targets are also generated so that a jump coinciding with a side-blade kick doesnot necessarily need to be acquired from that side.  This was a compromise between requiring correct visual acquisition, and having the time required to visually acquire a low-lying jump hurdle from the side slow down the action of the game.
    
    <h2>Side-Blade Kick Train</h2>
    
    <p>In additiona to individual Side-Blade Kicks, Smash Box will produce kick targets for a train of multiple Side-Blade Kicks in a row because this is useful in developing balance.
    
    <h2>Blocks</h2>
    
    <p>Some targets are intended to make you put your hands in position to block incoming punches.  For instance, some targets encurage you to keep your hands up next to your face.  These are called "Blocks" because you are blocking simulated incoming punches or kicks.  In a normal block you keep your right hand up on the right and your left hand up on the left.  Single targets are used because there is no follow-through-- you just keep your hands in position.  Unlike e.g. the "Reflex Alley" in Knockout League, there are no special targets or special moves for blocks in Smash Box.
    
    <h2>Cross Blocks</h2>
    
    <p>In some blocks coming from high above the right-hand target is on the left and the left-hand target is on the right.  These are special blocks called "Cross Blocks" because you cross your arms to make the block and presumably the incoming strike would land at the point between the fists where the arms are crossed.  Cross blocks are useful because they can stop Hammer Strikes and/or Kicks that come in with too much force to be blocked by a single hand.  The disadvantage of the Cross Block is that it requires "two weapons" (i.e. both arms) whereas often a simple incoming punch and be blocked with a single arm.
    
    <h2>Blocking Random Targets</h2>
    
    <p>At different times Smash Box will present a set of random targets for you to block.  As these are targets to block they are single targets with no follow-through.
    
    <h2>Front-Ball Kicks</h2>
    
    <p>Smash Box produces kick targets for the normal Front-Ball Kick that is common in martial arts.
    
    <h2>Roundhouse Kicks</h2>
    
    <p>Smash Box produces kick targets for Roundhouse Kicks.  Roundhouse Kicks are fairly common in the martial arts.  The Roundhouse Kick has more side-to-side motion than a Front-Ball kick, but it's an oversimplification to say that a Roundhouse Kick is merely a kick with side-to-side motion.
    
    <h2>Front-Ball Kick Followed By Roundhouse Kick</h2>
    
    <p>Smash Box produces kick targets for a defensive maneuver using both a Front-Ball Kick and a Roundhouse Kick.  First execute the Front-Ball Kick, then the kick targets will indicate that you drop your foot briefly, and then you finally go into the Roundhouse Kick.
    
    <h2>Boxing Gloves</h2>
    
    <p>The boxing "gloves" for Smash Box are a small red box for the right hand and a small green box for the left hand.  I used shapes that were simple and would download quickly.  Also I chose smaller "gloves" over larger ones because smaller "gloves" emphasize accuracy.
    
    <h2>Does the author have any certifications in Exercise Physiology, Sports Medicine, or Personal Training?</h2>
    
    <p>No.  The author's background is in Computer Graphics / Computer-Aided Geometric Design and he has only briefly touched on the topic of exercise.  No representations are made about the game.  Play at your own risk.

    <h2>Frameworks</h2>

    <p>Smash Box uses the <A href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js</A> library.  The latest version of <A href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js</A> is available <A href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">here</A>.  Multiple <A href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js</A> examples can be found <A href="https://threejs.org/examples/">here</A>.  The book "AR and VR using the WebXR API" by Rakesh Baruah also provided a lot of useful <A href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js</A> examples.
    
    <p>The collision sound was created using <A href="https://github.com/viridian1138/SndHnd">SndHnd</A> with some final clipping and format conversions done using Audacity.

    <h2>Browser</h2>

    <p>Smash Box should work in any browser that supports <A href="https://immersive-web.github.io/">WebXR</A>.  Testing was done using recent versions of Google Chrome on Windows.
